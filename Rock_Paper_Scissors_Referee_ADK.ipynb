        "# AI Game Referee: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Plus\n",
        "\n",
        "## My Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "For this assignment, I wanted to build more than just a chatbot wrapper. My primary goal was to solve the common \"LLM Hallucination\" problem. Since LLMs are probabilistic, they often lose track of scores or invent rules in long conversations.\n",
        "\n",
        "To fix this, I treated the assignment as a **Systems Engineering** problem. I separated the \"Brain\" (Gemini) from the \"Rulebook\" (Python), ensuring the game is mathematically fair and deterministic while still feeling conversational.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. How I Managed Game State\n",
        "\n",
        "The requirements stated that the game state must not live only in the prompt. I took this strictly.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Single Source of Truth:** I created a Pydantic-style `GameState` class that lives in the Python runtime, not in the chat history.\n",
        "* **What it Tracks:** It explicitly holds the `round_count`, numeric scores, and crucially boolean flags for `user_bomb_used`.\n",
        "* **Why I did this:** This ensures that even if the LLM \"forgets\" I used a bomb in Round 1, the Python object remembers. The LLM simply reads this immutable state every turn.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. The \"Blind Referee\" Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "I designed the agent to act as a **Interface Layer**, not a Judge.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Intent Understanding:** The Gemini Agent's only job is to understand what the user wants to do (e.g., \"I throw a rock\").\n",
        "* **The Logic Engine (Tool):** I built a deterministic tool called `resolve_round`. The Agent is forced via system instructions to pass every move to this tool.\n",
        "* **The flow:** User Input $\\rightarrow$ Agent parses intent $\\rightarrow$ Tool calculates winner $\\rightarrow$ Agent reports result.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Trade-offs & Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Strict \"Wasted Round\" Rule:** The prompt required that \"Invalid input wastes the round\". I had to choose between a friendly UX (asking \"did you mean rock?\") or strict compliance. I chose **strict compliance**. If a user types \"Lizard\", the logic engine catches it, increments the round counter, and awards zero points. This felt more aligned with a \"Referee\" persona.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Handling API Limits:** During testing, I hit the Google Free Tier rate limit (429 Errors). Instead of letting the program crash, I added a **Failover Mechanism**. If the API is busy, the game catches the error and switches to a \"Backup Referee\" mode that prints the raw engine result. This keeps the user's session alive even if the cloud service hiccups.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Improvements with More Time\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Persistence:** Currently, the state is in-memory. If I had more time, I would implement a simple SQLite database so a user could close the script and resume their game later.\n",
        "* **Better UI:** Moving from the CLI to a web interface (like Streamlit) would make the \"Round History\" much easier to visualize."
